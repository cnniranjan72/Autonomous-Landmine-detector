# 🚀 Autonomous Landmine Detection System

## 🔍 Overview
An intelligent **autonomous landmine detection system** that leverages **deep learning (CNNs)** to detect and classify buried landmines.  
The system processes data from **Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)** and **magnetometry sensors**, designed for deployment on **UAVs (drones)** or **ground robots** for safe, real-time mine detection.
